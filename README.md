## What is this?

This browser plugin solves a personal pet-peeve. At the [ERATO-MMSD](https://group-mmm.org/eratommsd/) lab, we often play the [NYT Games](https://www.nytimes.com/games) during our coffee breaks.

1. When you solve the [NYT Minicrossword](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini) a jingle is played.
2. When you solve the [NYT Connections Puzzle]() or the [NYT Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands), no jingle is played.

If you install this plugin, a jingle will be played when you solve the Connections Puzzle or Strands game.
